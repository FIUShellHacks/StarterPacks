Well you've come to the right place. Buildings games (Or any kind of Human Driven Simulation) is becoming an important part of the tech landscape with technologies such as VR/AR and Gamification coming into the scene. Simulations can be incredibly complex pieces of software, but don't worry!! In this guide I'll do my best to provide ShellHacks/Online resources that will be useful to either begin learning or perfecting the art of making games. 

**Focused Area of Interest**
This Starter Pack is aimed at the Hacker with an interest in building a hack around Human Interaction, Game Engines, Game Oriented Design, and AR/VR.

**General Development Tools**
Just like someone about to start on their Pokemon Journey, you will have to choose between a couple of Game Engines. They all have their pros and cons, but any of them will be good to hack on. I do however highly recommend Unity since there will be a Unity Workshop at ShellHacks and a couple of organizers/volunteeers have experience in Unity if you ever need help. 

- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) : Unity is one of the, if not the most, popular game engines out there. Unity provides plenty of resources for bigginers and it's intuitive GUI interface makes it a perfect fit for a quick hack. You will be using C# to write your scripts, more resources on that on Online resouces. (Supports VR and AR)

- [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) : Unreal Engine 4 is a high end game engine that powers some of the best triple A titles out there. Unreal is consider by many as the Game Engine with best performance and graphics, which at the same token bring a hightened level of dificulty. You will be using C++ to write you code, more resources on that on Online Resources. 

- [Amazon Lumberyard](https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/): Amazon Lumberyard is a moded version of the CryEngine Game Engine. The cool thing about this game engine is it's direct support to Amazon Web services such as AWS (Which if you did not know, Amazon is giving away AWS credits for free at ShellHacks). Because the engine is in Beta and lack of online resources, expect a hightened dificulty. You will be using C++ to write you code, more resources on that on Online Resources. 

**Companies of Interest**
These are some companies that have involvement in Game Development (Or are directly affected by it, such as Microsoft with their upcoming Mixed Reality Headsets and Hololens)
- Amazon
- Microsoft 
- Facebook
